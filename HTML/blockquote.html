    Telugu (/ˈtɛlʊɡuː/;[5] తెలుగు, Telugu pronunciation: [ˈt̪eluɡu]) is a Dravidian language native to the Indian states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, where it is also the official language. Spoken by about 96 million people (2022),[6] Telugu is the most widely spoken member of the Dravidian language family, and one of the twenty-two scheduled languages of the Republic of India.[7] It is one of the few languages that has primary official status in more than one Indian state, alongside Hindi and Bengali.[8] Telugu is one of the six languages designated as a classical language by the Government of India. It is the 14th most spoken native language in the world.[9] Modern Standard Telugu is based on the dialect of Godavarikhani- Manchiryal region in Telangana.[10][11][12]
    
    Telugu is also spoken in the states of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Odisha and the union territories of Puducherry and Andaman and Nicobar Islands. It is also spoken by members of the Telugu diaspora spread across countries like United States, Australia, Malaysia, Mauritius, UAE, Saudi Arabia and others.[13][14] Telugu is the fastest-growing language in the United States.[15] It is also a protected language in South Africa and is offered as an optional third language in schools in KwaZulu-Natal province.[4][16]
    
    According to Mikhail S. Andronov, Telugu split from the Proto-Dravidian language around 1000 BCE.[17][18] Earliest inscriptions with Telugu words date back to c. 400 BCE in Bhattiprolu of Andhra Pradesh.[19][20][21] Telugu words were also found in the inscriptions of Emperor Ashoka (257 BCE), Satavahanas, and Vishnukundinas.[22][23] Inscriptions in Old Telugu script were found as far away as Indonesia and Myanmar.[24] Telugu was the court language of various dynasties of Southern India namely the Kakatiyas, Vijayanagara Empire, Eastern Chalukyas, Eastern Gangas, Qutb Shahis, Madurai Nayaks, Thanjavur Nayaks.[29] Telugu was used officially as a language of bureaucracy outside its homeland even by non-Telugu dynasties like the Thanjavur Marathas in Tamil Nadu.[30][26]
