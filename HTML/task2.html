    <h4>How to design a favicon</h4>
 <p>  A favicon is a browser icon that represents a brand or website. Most often seen next to a web page's title in browser tabs, favicons can also be found in address bars, bookmark lists, search engine results pages (SERPs), toolbars, browser history, and other places across the web.</p>
<h3> How To Create a Good Favicon</h3>
A lot of things need to be taken into consideration when creating and designing a favicon for your website. While small and simple, it can (and should) have a big impact. It’s important to make sure you produce the best favicon possible as this is what users will identify your brand with. Here are some things to keep in mind when creating your favicon:
<ul>
<li><b>Use sapce wisely:</b>
A favicon sometimes can’t always simply be a smaller version of your company logo. Consideration needs to be given to the overall size of your favicon. You should stick to 16px since this is acceptable by all browsers (but you can find other examples below).</li>

<li><b>Simplicity:</b>
Though the favicon is the visual face of your brand, you want to keep your design as simple as possible. The best favicons are the simplest. Due to the small size of the favicon and the simplicity of shapes used, colors are vital for catching the eye of potential consumers and standing out. Too much detail will only make the favicon look cluttered and messy.</li>
<li><b>Brand Identity:</b>
Your favicon is the visual icon for your brand, so it should visually tell users what your business represents. This tells them instantly what your brand is about and what it does.
Although this is very hard to do with such a small and simple design, try to be creative. The examples below demonstrate the power of small, creative favicons; at first glance, you can instantly gather what the brand is about and what they represent.</li>

<li><b>Abbreviating:</b>
Finding the perfect visual may not be practical for what your business does. A common solution to this is to use the first letter of your business name or acronyms. You may also choose to use an abbreviation of your company name. Play around with some different variations and choose the one that works best for you.</li>
</ul>
